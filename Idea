Some minor ideas.
Implement achievement for buying the pre's transaction faster without having to type in sdator missile.
include infraction page on the scoreboard (when right clicking on a player.) view the playerteamid
Make a brief describtion what the gamemode is about, i see so many new players ask how to make an boat float etc, of course i can help with that though.
The !motd will automatically pop out when joining the game, where you have to wait 15 seconds before it closes
When making a ban in chat convert it to days instead of minutes.
allow moderators to physgun/toolgun other props since they have access to !clean
