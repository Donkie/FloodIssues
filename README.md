# Devinity Flood Issuetracker

This is used to track bugs/issues and requests more easily with the community.

## Labels
Github uses labels for easier grouping, here's an explanation of them:  
* Bug - A gameplay or non-gameplay breaking issue. Code-wise or content-wise.
* Modification - A balancing or other type of modification that's required to make the gamemode better. This is different from a bug where a bug is a direct issue where modification is more an annoyancey type of thing.
* Higgs Bugson - A bug which is hard to reproduce and only show up during specific circumstances
* Idea - A minor request which is easy to implement. A weapon is not easy to implement, changing font of the scoreboard is.
* Major Idea - A large request which might/will take a long time to develop. Including weapons, new menus, other functionality.
